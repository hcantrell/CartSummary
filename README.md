Cart Summary Component

This is a React Native iOS Test

The goal of this exercise is to build a “Purchase Summary” user interface (gif attached and linked here) using React Native. 

Key UI elements: 

- The “Pickup savings” tooltip
- The “See Item details” expander
- The “Apply Promo code” expander

The user should be able to enter a promo code “DISCOUNT” and on applying it, see a 10% discount reflect in the purchase summary. Use Redux for this.
Please refrain from using existing css frameworks like (bootstrap, foundation etc.).

1. Setup the React Native CLI:
- npm install -g react-native-cli

2. Run this Solution:
- react-native run-ios

OR open ./ios/CartSummary.xcworkspace in Xcode and run
